## Assignment 07
### Assignment Description
This programming assignment, a rehash of assignment 4, was about implementing the simplification and derivation of an expression in Cinnameg. The same constraints as assignment 4 were implemented. This assignment was meant to emphasis, partially, object-oriented programming but also mixed in equational programming.
