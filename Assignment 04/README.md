## Assignment 04
### Assignment Description
This assignment, using Scheme, was about taking the derivative of an expression defined using scheme syntax (such as `(^ 2 (* x 3)))`), and simplifying that taken derivative. If a derivative could not be simplified - that is, there was a variable, 'x', in the exponent - then it was simply to be listed as `(deriv <exp>)`. Derivatives were restricted only to numbers, subexpressions, or the variable x.

The R5RS language under legacy languages in Racket was used for this assignment.
