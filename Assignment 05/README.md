This assignment, written in Cinnameg, regards the n-queens problem. The n-queens problem is a question of, given an n-by-n chessboard, can a queen be placed in each row and column (with only one per row and column) such as none of the queens can attack each other. A utility file, `nqueens-tool.cmg`, was provided for our usage. This programming assignment was primarily meant to emphasis the concept of backtracking.
