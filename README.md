## Course Information
<b>Semester Taken:</b> Fall 2018 <br/>
<b>Code, Name:</b> CSCI 3675, Organization of Programming Languages <br/>
<b>Instructor:</b> Karl Abrahamson <br/>
<b>Language(s):</b> Java, Cinnameg, Prolog, Scheme <br />

Description: <br/>
Organization of Programming Languages was a course with more emphasis on the design of a programming language, such as garbage collection and other memory management techniques, dynamic versus static typing, and object-oriented inheritance. It also covered different types of programming, such as equational, functional, higher-order, and object-oriented programming, making reference to programming languages such as C, C++, Java, Lisp, Scheme, Haskell, Python, etc. <br/>

**What is Cinnameg?** <br/>
Cinnameg is a multi-paradigm programming language built by Dr. Karl Abrahamson. It allows multiple types of programming to be done through a singular interface, including equational, functional, and object-oriented programming. It was the primary programming language of the course. Information can be found here: http://www.cs.ecu.edu/~karl/
