## Assignment 06
### Assignment Description
This programming assignment, written using Prolog, emphasized the concept of logic programming and modes of operation (using In/Out). The idea of the programming assignment was, given a list of missionaries and cannibals, could all the missionaries and cannibals be carried across the river via boat - a boat of which only held two people maximum, with one person required to row it. If there were more cannibals than missionaries at any point in time, then that path chosen was incorrect, and backtracking was required.

_I personally found this programming assignment the most challenging of the semester_.
